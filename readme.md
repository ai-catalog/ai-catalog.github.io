# AI Catalog

A minimal, curated directory of AI tools.  
The goal is to keep things simple: a clean list of genuinely useful tools, a few trusted affiliate recommendations, and no unnecessary clutter.

This project is built as a lightweight static site hosted on GitHub Pages.  
No frameworks, no backend — just fast, minimal HTML and CSS.

## What this will become
- A curated list of AI tools across different categories  
- A small set of affiliate recommendations (max 3)  
- A clean, distraction‑free interface  
- A transparent approach to monetization  
- A simple way for users to discover high‑quality AI tools

## Why this exists
Most AI directories are overloaded, slow, or filled with sponsored noise.  
AI Catalog aims to be the opposite: minimal, honest, and easy to navigate.

## Status
Early prototype.  
The structure, layout, and content will evolve as the project grows.
